# Task1

# Problem Statement

 * Using programming platform, create a short automated test suite (3-5 test cases will be sufficient) using following instructions:

"Send http GET request to target url { http://ptsv2.com/t/fu807-1554722621/post } and read response body. This body will contain following fields:

username,
password,
targetUrl

* This { targetUrl } endpoint uses BASIC Authorization method. Send a POST request to { targetUrl } using credentials received { username, password } and create 3 testcases to validate response body.

Recommendations for Task 1: 
use of NodeJS would be an advantage;
